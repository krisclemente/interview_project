# Given what you now know about arrays.  Take the given array of integers here:

integers = [1, 4, 6, 16, 30]
integers2 = [15, 2, 30, 17, 8, 20, 44]

# Complete the function below so that it returns the average of the numbers above

def average( arr )
  #CODE HERE
end

puts "Average of integers:"
puts average(integers)
puts "Average of integers2:"
puts average(integers2)

#HINTS: 
# You'll need to iterage over each integer in the array
# You'll need to convert the sum into a float (decimal) 
# in order to get an an average that is also in float.
