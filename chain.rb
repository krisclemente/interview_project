#Say you have a string that you want to make all upper case:

our_string = "bananarama"

#You could do so with the upcase method, like this:

new_string = our_string.upcase

#lets say you also wanted to reverse the string. You could do so with the reverse method:


rev_string = new_string.reverse

#But you don't need to do these operations seperately. They can be chained together, like this:

this_string = our_string.upcase.reverse

#If we want to add one string to another, we can use the plus sign:

final_string = this_string + rev_string

#Using this information, can you write one line of code that will combine the two variables below 
#into the string "LOOTCRATE" and store them in the variable output?

c = "etarc"
l = "tool"

output =
puts output
